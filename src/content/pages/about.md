# Our Story: From NYC Streets to Digital Frontiers

When we first set up shop as ALEX COVO STUDIO NYC, we never imagined the incredible journey ahead. From the bustling streets of New York to the far corners of the globe, our passion for storytelling and commitment to excellence have become the very fabric of our being.

What started as a creative boutique specializing in photography and video production has evolved into a cutting-edge studio where creativity meets artificial intelligence. But one thing remains constant: we still treat every client as our one and only partner.
